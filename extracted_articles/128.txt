Client BackgroundClient: A leading Entertainment firm in the USAIndustry Type:  EntertainmentServices: MusicOrganization Size: 100+Project ObjectiveThe objective of this project is to split a song into its vocals and instrumental.Project DescriptionThe project aims at taking a Hindi language song as input and separating the vocals(lyrics) from the instrumental music of the song. Save both the vocals and instrumental files separately as output.Our SolutionI have used Python programming language for this project. The use of a Python library called Spleeter developed by Deezer has been made to achieve our goal.Spleeter is Deezer source separation library with pretrained models written in Python and uses Tensorflow. It makes it easy to train source separation model (assuming you have a dataset of isolated sources), and provides already trained state of the art model for performing various flavor of separation :Vocals (singing voice) / accompaniment separation (2 stems)Vocals / drums / bass / other separation (4 stems)Vocals / drums / bass / piano / other separation (5 stems)2 stems and 4 stems models have high performance on the musdb dataset. Spleeter is also very fast as it can perform separation of audio files to 4 stems 100x faster than real-time when run on a GPU.Project DeliverablesPython tool that takes Hindi song as input and gives two audio files as output: vocals file and instrumental file.Language/techniques usedPythonModels used2 Stems modelSkills usedAdvanced Python programmingProject Snapshots
