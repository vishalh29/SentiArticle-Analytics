Home  Our Success Stories  NFT Data Automation (looksrare), and ETL tool
















Client BackgroundClient: A leading tech firm in the USAIndustry Type: IT ServicesServices: Blockchain, NFTOrganization Size: 10+Project ObjectiveTo scrape all the desired information regarding the NFTs from a website and store them in a database to be accessed later on.Project DescriptionMatthew Brown – extract all events, all time from this https://looksrare.org/explore/activity . We can then pay you weekly to keep them up to date. You can choose any technology you like, as long as it’s updated into an SQL database. Additional tasks may be to make an alert or dashboard from data, later access API when it becomes available.Our SolutionWe provided a robust solution which returned the NFT data every 8 hours into the google big query database. To do this we used selenium web driver to scrape all events as the website was dynamic and did not have a format data structure to scrape data using AJAX POST calls. After automating the scarper the data was manipulated and constructed into a desired format into pandas dataframe, which was later used to push the dataframe into the google big query database using Google cloud api and credentials. The data was getting collected every day and about 50M distinct rows were created.Project DeliverablesWebcrawler and databaseTools usedPython  Selenium  GBQLanguage/techniques usedPython  Selenium web scraper  Pandas Google big query Parallel processing.Databases usedSQL Google BigQueryWeb Cloud Servers usedGoogle BigQueryWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionThe only technical challenge faced during this project was that the website used to keep changing the elements on their webpage and used to cause error. Though it did not use to happen regularly, it happened 3 times in 5 weeks. Also AJAX calls were not proper.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedIdentifying the elements solved the issue. Also remote access to a better desktop enabled me to keep working as well as keep the code running all the time.Business ImpactSupplied upto 50 million rows data regarding NFTs.Provided a python solution with optimal functions and code to be used and automate them to save the data into a database on a daily basis.Caused a huge influx of data which can be used to make many insightful decisions regarding the nft market.Project SnapshotsProject website urlhttps://looksrare.org/explore/activity
