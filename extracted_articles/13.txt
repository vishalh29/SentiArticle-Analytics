Client BackgroundClient: A leading IT & tech firm in the USAIndustry Type: ITProducts & Services: IT Consulting, IT Support, SaaSOrganization Size: 200+The ProblemOur client, a leading research institution, faced challenges in collecting rich, engaging data through traditional survey methods. Participants often found surveys tedious and uninteresting, leading to low response rates and limited insights. Additionally, the client sought a way to accommodate participants who preferred verbal communication over written responses.Our SolutionTo address these challenges, proposed integrating Generative AI technology into the Qualtrics platform. This would allow for dynamic, AI-driven conversations with participants, making the survey experience more interactive and personalized. Additionally, we suggested implementing speech-to-text functionality to cater to participants who preferred vocalizing their responses.Solution ArchitectureIn solution involved integrating ChatGPT and Gemini AI models into the Qualtrics environment. Participants could engage in conversations with the AI either by typing or speaking their prompts. Speech inputs were processed using Gemini’s speech-to-text capabilities, enabling seamless interaction with the AI models.Deliverables Integration of ChatGPT and Gemini AI with Qualtrics
