Data ScienceWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionThe problem was the higher GPU limit is required to process the big dataset.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedWe shifted our notebook from Google Colab to Kaggle Notebook as it offers more GPU usage limits. Also, we took sample data from a given big dataset and processed it quickly.Business ImpactThe project successfully implemented a text classification solution using BERT-based models. The model achieved promising results in classifying people into organizational categories. The documentation outlines the steps from data loading to model training and evaluation, providing a comprehensive project overview.Project SnapshotsProject Website URLhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1sYlohokwi6e0ITZALvBJvrJkJdL79Rm2/view?usp=sharingProject Videohttps://www.loom.com/share/d1390fced221473ea78d360f5c61fac5SummarizeSummarized: https://blackcoffer.com/This project was done by the Blackcoffer Team, a Global IT Consulting firm.Contact DetailsThis solution was designed and developed by Blackcoffer TeamHere are my contact details:Firm Name: Blackcoffer Pvt.
