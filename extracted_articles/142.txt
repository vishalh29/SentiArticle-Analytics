Home  Our Success Stories  Sentimental Analysis on Shareholder Letter of Companies
















Client BackgroundClient: A leading financial firm in the USAIndustry Type: Financial services & ConsultingServices: Financial consultantOrganization Size: 100+Project ObjectiveProject “Sentimental Analysis on Shareholder Letter of Companies” objective was to Predict the Sentiments columns Shareholder Letter in terms of Polarity and Subjectivity finally classification of data into positive, negative and neutral tone.Project DescriptionThe project ‘Sentimental Analysis on Shareholder Letter of US Companies’ task involved data cleaning on shareholder letters of different companies which includes lemmatization, lower case conversion, removing special character, \n , \t , punctuations, numbers & single character and tokenization. To generate polarity and subjectivity columns for the letter 1 & letter 2 columns using the Textblob library of NLTK. Based on the polarity categorizing it into positive, neutral  &  negative. Our SolutionLetter Text Length VariationContraction mapping on datasetReplacing missing value with some neutral tone string like None so that cleaning doesn’t generate any issue. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing which involves :             i.  Lemmatisation             ii. lower case conversion             iii.  Removing Special character             iv.  Removing \n , \t etc             v.  remove punctuations, numbers & single character removal            vi.  forming list of letter data using tqdmTokenization and word count.Used Textblob Library which is part of NLTK for Sentiment analysis.Created Polarity and Subjectivity column for the Letter1 & Letter2 columnsBased on the polarity of letter 1 created a letter1_type column with values “positive” , “neutral”  &  “negative” category.Project DeliverablesOutput iPython FilePreprocessed DatasetTools used● Jupyter Notebook● Anaconda● Notepad++● Sublime Text● Brackets● Python 3.4Language/techniques usedPythonMachine LearningNLP (Natural Language Processing)Models usedMy project ‘Sentimental Analysis on Shareholder Letter of Companies’ developed with a software model which makes the project high quality, reliable and cost effective.● Software Model : Waterfall Model● For Project ‘Sentimental Analysis on Shareholder Letter of US Companies’ is a Waterfall Model as our model is not forming the loop from end to the start using Textblob which predicts Sentiments, Polarity and Subjectivity as the output following the Waterfall Model.Skills usedPandas OperationsData Chunking and IntegrationData VisualizationDatabases usedNo Database is used to complete this project.Web Cloud Servers usedNo Web cloud Server was required for this work.What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionI have worked before on tasks similar to this so there were no challenges faced but the data cleaning was a bit different and required time to complete.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedAs Discussed no technical Challenges were faced during this project.Project Snapshots Figure 1: Input Data SchemaFigure 2: Output Data SchemaFigure 3: Sample Input Datasetfigure 3 is pandas dataframe which was fetched from google cloud database there were 7 columns and 13290 rows.Figure 4: Sample Output Datasetfigure 4 is output pandas dataframe after data cleaning and modeling of sentiment identification there are 13 columns and 13290 rows.Figure 5: Sentiments assignment based on polarityfigure 5 represents the identification of sentiments and tone based on polarity and subjectivity. polarity>0 then sentiment type is positive,  if the polarity<0 sentiment type is negative and if the polarity=0 sentiment type is neutral.Figure 6:  Histogram Representation of Length of Shareholder Letter 1figure 6 is histogram plot between length of shareholder letter 1 among the final output dataset.Figure 7:  Histogram Representation of Length of Shareholder Letter 2figure 7 is Histogram plot between length of shareholder letter 2 among the final output dataset.Figure 8: Flow Chart
