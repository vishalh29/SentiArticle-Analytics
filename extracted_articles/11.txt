Client BackgroundClient: A leading IT & tech firm in the USAIndustry Type: ITProducts & Services: IT Consulting, IT Support, SaaSOrganization Size: 200+The ProblemTo improve the accuracy to 90%+ where the current models which were built were giving an accuracy of 58%. The existing predictive models are currently achieving an accuracy of 58%, which is insufficient for meeting the desired performance benchmarks. The objective is to enhance the accuracy of these models to exceed 90%. This requires a comprehensive evaluation and improvement of the model development process, including data quality, feature engineering, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The challenge lies in identifying and implementing effective strategies to significantly boost the model’s predictive accuracy while ensuring robustness and generalizability.Our SolutionOur solution architecture is designed to efficiently preprocess financial data, perform feature selection, and train a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model for predictive analysis. The architecture comprises the following components:Data Preprocessing: Involves loading the dataset from a CSV file, checking for null values, and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).Feature Selection: Utilizes correlation analysis to identify relevant features and drop irrelevant ones.Model Building: Constructs a GRU model using TensorFlow’s Keras API, consisting of multiple GRU layers followed by dropout regularization and a dense output layer with a sigmoid activation function.Model Evaluation: Evaluates the trained model on test data to measure its performance.Solution ArchitectureDeliverablesCustom Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature selection, and model building.Trained GRU model saved to a file for future use.Tech StackTools used
